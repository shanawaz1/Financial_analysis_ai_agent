Look at all the scenarios that we're going through with a lot of deflationary effects being put in by the administration.  Tariffs are inflationary, but deportations could potentially be deflationary.  Doge is definitely deflationary.  So when you're looking at it from that perspective, there are some triggers that could come during the Fed statement and during the Fed speech that could put downside pressure on gold."

It doesn't really expect it to raise its outlook just yet at the next earnings that we'll have in  October, but said that the guidance range could be potentially narrowed towards the high end of that guidance. The latest update that we got from Tesco this summer was actually very positive. So, that's kind of a continuation of this. We saw solid sales growth, growth in market share as well. So, it's actually managed to do quite well despite the very competitive pricing environment in the U.K. where we saw, you know, low-cost retailers like Aldi and Lidl really driving down those prices.
